<h1 align="center">ABOUT ME</h1>

<h3 align="center">As a second-generation immigrant in the United States, my life has had certain ideals instilled in me. Being of Nigerian descent I have been taught the importance of hard work, discipline, and integrity in what I do. However, many of my most self-deemed significant values were cultivated outside of ties to my heritage. I came to realize my identity is more multifaceted than what I would have initially thought, and extended into many places. I am an artist, a coder, a writer, and an all-around creative. My creativity has given me the openness to take on new perspectives and ideas. It has also given me the flexibility to adapt to new circumstances and take advantage of opportunities. The determination to follow things through, yet curbed by careful consideration of alternative ideas is something that has allowed me to cultivate the artifacts and experiences I am presenting in this portfolio. Having moved a few times while growing up, has only further shaped my flexibility and openness. I was somewhat of a recluse while in high school but this allowed me to develop my most noteworthy trait. Being able to observe carefully. All of these aspects of my identity, my values, and what I have gone through growing up have allowed me to foster new experiences and are represented in my artifacts. I had the determination to go through certain paths, the openness to go out of my comfort zone, the flexibility to adapt, and the carefulness to know my own strengths and weaknesses.</h3>
